# About The Development
First of all I was very happy with the result I got because I used a framework that I had no experience with along with Tailwind which is a library that I also had no experience with. I tried to take advantage of the Server Side Rendering that Next provides and I went through some challenges with TypeScript but nothing that gave me a headache.

Tailwind surprised me positively when comparing it to Bootstrap and I will definitely study it further.

My biggest challenge is the time to carry out this project, but that will not stop me from doing it.
